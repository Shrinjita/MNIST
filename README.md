# MNIST-784 Handwritten Digit Classification

This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each represented as a 28x28 pixel matrix (784 total features per image).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the handwritten digit in each image. We use the following steps to achieve this:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and reshaping of the input data for model training.
2. **Model Development**: Implementation of deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, CNN) using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on 60,000 training samples and evaluated on 10,000 test samples, measuring accuracy and other relevant metrics.
4. **Visualization**: Displaying sample images, loss curves, and accuracy metrics for analysis.

## Key Features
- **Input Data**: 28x28 pixel images, flattened into 784 feature vectors.
- **Models**: Various architectures explored (e.g., Fully Connected Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Precision/Recall.
- **Deployment**: Model inference and deployment for real-time digit recognition (optional).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MNIST-784.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:
